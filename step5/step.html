          5.Finding Annulo- Papillary distance
          <br><br>
          Knowing the precise location of papillary muscles is very important in implanting Avatar due to its chorded nature. So, first specifying the annulo-papillary distance becomes the major step in this implantation planning.
          <br>
          Annulo- papillary distance is the distance from the centre of the mitral valve’s annulus to the tip of the papillary muscle. To find the two extremes of the annulo-papillary distances, we will be using the end systole and end diastole stages instead of using all 0-100% cycle phases.

          CAUTION:
          <br><br>
          The limitation with 3Mensio software is that it does not allow for the creation of planes within the workspace. So, the only option is to virtually reference the annulus plane. To reference the slanting plane, the trigones become crucial features. We can assume that the virtual plane we are envisioning aligns with the line formed by the center point and the two trigones.

          Now, you have got annulo-papillary distances. These distances are for you to estimate how far the muscles are from the centre of the annulus.But these dimensions alone are not enough for getting the precise location of the papillary muscle when doing the open heart surgery and viewing the mitral valve from the top.To visualise the movement of the valve throughout the whole cardiac cycle, the precise x,y,z coordinates are needed. To find the x,y,z distances of each muscle from the centre, we will be setting the annulus plane as the reference.
          <br>
          Note : Make sure you have located trigones and turned on visibility for mitral annulus ring. Leave the APM, PPM and centre markers as they were. To see the distances and angles measurements clearly, we will be using the top right side of the 3Mensio workspace this time.

          <i class="ri-circle-fill"></i>When adjusting the angle, it is important to rotate around and see if the triangle shaped formed is lying flat on the plane.

          <br><br>
          <i class="ri-circle-fill"></i>After setting all four markers, rotate around and see if all the points somewhat lie on the plane.
